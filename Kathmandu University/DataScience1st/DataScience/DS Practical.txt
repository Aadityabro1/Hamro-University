-Implementing Machine Learning Models Using Weka Tool.
-installing Hadoop application and using map reduce programming to solve the word count problem.
-Lab1 and Lab2 done,, Lab3(Graded,Data Visualization -I),Lab4(Machine Learning-I),
Lab5(Graded,ML-II)
-weka tool file extension(file_name.arff)

-load the iris dataset
-go to the classify tab
-choose trees:J48(decision tree algorithm)
-%split=80 for training 
-and then start 
-it will be trained on the dataset and also test for the remaining dataset .
-mean absolute error need to be minimized and ,so on 

-misclassified data(due to not enough training , the data model cannot classify all the remaining dataset with absolute accuracy.

.CROSS VALIDATION (during training the dataset)
-dividing the given dataset into ten folds and training with 9 dataset and testing with the remaining one.

.CONFUSION MATRIX
