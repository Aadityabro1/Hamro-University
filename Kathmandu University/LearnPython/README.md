# Learn Python

Quick scripts that illustrate core Python concepts. Run them directly with a Python 3 interpreter.

## Files

- `basics.py`: Prints variables, types, and basic math operations.
- `loops.py`: Demonstrates `for` loops, `while` loops, and list comprehensions.
- `functions.py`: Shows function definitions, default arguments, and docstrings.
- `file_io.py`: Reads and writes simple text files safely.

Execute a file like:

```bash
python basics.py
```
