### What is Data Science?

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses statistics, computing, visualization, algorithms and domain knowledge to extract actionable insights from structured or unstructured data. A typical data‑science project lifecycle includes:

- Data ingestion — collecting raw data from databases, APIs, sensors (IoT), logs, social media, etc.
- Data storage & processing — storing data in appropriate systems (data warehouses, data lakes) and performing cleaning, deduplication, transformation and ETL.
- Data analysis — exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model development (statistical models, machine learning, deep learning).
- Communication — presenting findings through reports and visualizations so stakeholders can make decisions.

### Bachelor of Data Science (BDSc) — Program summary

The Department of Mathematics launched the BDSc program in August 2024. The four‑year program is practice‑oriented, combining lectures, labs, workshops and research projects. It emphasizes statistics, mathematics, computer science and business intelligence.

### Why Data Science matters for Nepal

Data science can accelerate Nepal's digital transformation across sectors:

- National identity and citizen services — consolidated identity systems improve service delivery
- Tax administration — analytics can detect evasion and improve compliance
- Disaster management — analytics and social signals support planning, response and recovery
- Tourism — mobility and preference data can improve services and security

As digital infrastructure grows, demand for data‑science skills in Nepal will continue to increase.
