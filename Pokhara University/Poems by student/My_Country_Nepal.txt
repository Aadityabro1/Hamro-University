In the land of Himalayas so tall,
Where the mountains rise, we stand in awe,
My country Nepal, a jewel so rare,
With beauty beyond compare, everywhere.

From the mighty peaks to the fertile plains,
Where culture and history forever remains,
My country Nepal, diverse and grand,
A tapestry of traditions across the land.

The flag of crimson and blue flies high,
Symbolizing bravery beneath the sky,
My country Nepal, land of the brave,
Where ancient stories and legends engrave.

The Ganges and the Indus rivers flow,
Through valleys where emerald crops grow,
My country Nepal, with nature's grace,
A tranquil, picturesque, and sacred space.

The rhododendrons bloom in the hills,
Where the air with their fragrance fills,
My country Nepal, with colors so bright,
A land of day and a starry night.

In Kathmandu's heart, the temples rise,
With intricate carvings that touch the skies,
My country Nepal, where faith resides,
In the hearts of people, deep and wide.

The laughter and smiles that people share,
Their warmth and kindness, always there,
My country Nepal, with a heart so warm,
In unity and love, we weather the storm.

From the Terai lowlands to mountains so steep,
In my country Nepal, our promises we keep,
To protect and cherish this land so dear,
For generations to come, let us persevere.

So, let us stand together, hand in hand,
Preserving the beauty of this sacred land,
My country Nepal, we'll forever be,
Proud of our heritage and our unity.
